This is a beautiful and modern HTML template with a design based on the latest web design trends: big images, big text, geometric fonts and more! Everything while keeping it lightweight and fast. There's not even JavaScript yet! That makes it really modern yet fast and efficient. I was inspired by websites like _Apple_, _Huawei_ and _Spotify_ to create this beauty.

## Typography

This template uses the geometric typeface **Manrope**, which looks pretty good in any size and gives a modern look to the website. Thanks to the Manrope Project Autors for providing this font for free, for both personal and commercial use.
